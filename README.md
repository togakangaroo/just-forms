This is a very simple project to demonstrate how to use simple forms with `FormData` to get validation, REST, and asynchronous submission support in your web applications in an idiomatic manner. It also shows examples of how you might integrate this approach into popular Javascript frameworks.

The web server used in the demo requires NodeJs to run, the technique itself requires nothing but a reasonably modern web browser.

To run this sample application, clone the repository and install dependencies with

     npm install
     
You can then launch the sample application with

     npm start
     
And view it by pointing your web browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
